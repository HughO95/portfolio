                       Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen is a must for all visitors to the city, young and old.
                       Tivoli is located just a few minutes walk from City Hall, and with the Copenhagen Central Station as its
                       nearest neighbour it is very easy to get to.<br /><br />

                       Tivoli Gardens was founded in 1843 and has become a national treasure and an international attraction.
                       Fairy tale writer Hans Christian Andersen visited many times, as did Walt Disney and many other celebrities,
                       who all fell in love with the gardens.<br /><br />

                       Part of Tivoli Gardens' secret is that there is something for everyone. The scenery is beautiful with exotic architecture,
                       historic buildings and lush gardens. At night, thousands of coloured lights create a fairy tale atmosphere that is completely unique.<br />

                        At Langelinje Pier you will find one of Copenhagen's most famous tourist attractions: The sculpture of The Little Mermaid. 23 August 2013 she turned 100 years old.

                        Unveiled on 23 August 1913, The Little Mermaid was a gift from Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen to the City of Copenhagen.

                        The sculpture is made of bronze and granite and was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale about a mermaid who gives up everything to be united with a young, handsome prince on land.

                        Every morning and evening she swims to the surface from the bottom of the sea and, perched on her rock in the water, she stares longingly towards the shore hoping to catch a glimpse of her beloved prince.

                        Freetown Christiania is a green and car-free neighbourhood in Copenhagen, best known for its autonomous inhabitants’ different way of life. It was established in 1971 by a group of hippies who occupied some abandoned military 
                        barracks on the site and developed their own set of society rules, completely independent of the Danish government.<br /><br />

                        Christiania existed under special conditions for 40 years with constant conflicts and clashes between the local Christianites and the Danish state. After many years of uncertainty about the future of Christiania, an agreement was entered in 2011, 
                        which meant that on 1 July 2012, a foundation, the Foundation Freetown Christiania, was founded. The foundation now owns the entire part of Christiania located outside the protected ramparts and leases buildings and land on the ramparts, 
                        which are still owned by the state. Part of the money is raised by selling the symbolic Christiania shares.<br /><br />

                        Freetown Christiania is a mix of homemade houses, workshops, art galleries, music venues, cheap and organic eateries, and beautiful nature. It is still a society within a society, for an example you cannot buy a house in Christiania. 
                        You have to apply for it, and if successful, it is given to you. The area is open to the public – even with guided tours, run by the local Christianites.<br />
